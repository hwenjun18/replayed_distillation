- i didnt let it subtract pixel means so it runs fast and lets me
  see if it works so if it doesnt maybe put it back in
CURRENT
- learning rate is smaller on vgg celeba to see if that helps


NEXT
- start distillation (stefano is running on train_vgg_celeba_normalize01_smallerlr) 
- start imagenet pretrain exp.
  small (0.0001) lr worked but overfit later on.
  smaller (0.00001) overfit less, but didnt achieve higher acc

- and if that fails go with cifar100.
